## A simple GUI pomodoro timer app made using the Tkinter library. 

### Functonality
- Has Start and Reset buttons which starts and resets the timer
- Once Started, it runs timer in the order of Work and Shortbreaks, after 4 complete reps it the timer sets to the long break
- Has a little Checkmark which shows how many reps you have completeted


Made this while I was watching Tkinter tutorial from the 100 days Python coursae by Dr. Angela Yu.

Will Add some functonalities of my mine own in future
